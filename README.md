# Hotel-Network
Network configuration for a three-floor hotel using three interconnected routers and switches on each floor. Each floor has specific VLANs and subnets for different hotel departments, with OSPF as the routing protocol. Devices obtain IPs via DHCP, enabling communication across the network. SSH is enabled on all routers for remote login.
